# Circle Detection in Images

This Python script uses OpenCV to detect and highlight the largest circular contour in an image. The script loads an image, processes it to detect edges, and then identifies the largest circular contour to overlay a green circumference and a red center point on the image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library for Python (`cv2`)

Install OpenCV with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
